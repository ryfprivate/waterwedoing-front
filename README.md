### Overview

Using open location data from Queensland Governement, this app help home buyers to find out how covenient the public transport systems are in the nearby suburbs. 

### Idea 

Our idea is to create a tool to help Queensland Residents to better access open data and get more information about the suburbs in their neighbourhood. Using the map tool, users can find out information about the surrounding suburbs, including how convenient it is to use the public transport system, crime rates, etc. Our implementtion currently only contains the public transport system use case.
